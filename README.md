# Introduction to uiCY

>uiCY is an Open-Source GUI program based on [scrCPY(Genymobile)](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) and [sndCPY(rom1v)](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy).It can be used to mirror your phone screen + internal audio to your PC(Windows/Linux)through USB data cable. It was made keeping bugdet gamers and streamers in mind whocannot afford devices like Elgato™. Indeed this program cannot give as much quality as Elgato™ but still it serves the purpose  i.e. you can easily stream/record at 480p.
